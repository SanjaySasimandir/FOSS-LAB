Free and open-source software (FOSS) is software that can be classified as both free software and open-source software.
That is, anyone is freely licensed to use, copy, study, and change the software in any way, and the source code is openly 
shared so that people are encouraged to voluntarily improve the design of the software.

why
Users of FOSS benefit from the Four Essential Freedoms to make unrestricted use of, and to study, copy, modify, and redistribute 
such software with or without modification. If they would like to change the functionality of software they can bring about changes
to the code and, if they wish, distribute such modified versions of the software or often − depending on the software's decision 
making model and its other users − even push or request such changes to be made via updates to the original software.

rivacy and security

Manufacturers of proprietary, closed-source software are sometimes pressured to building in backdoors or other covert, undesired 
features into their software. Instead of having to trust software vendors, users of FOSS can inspect and verify 
the source code themselves and can put trust on a community of volunteers and users.[36] As proprietary code is typically hidden 
from public view, only the vendors themselves and hackers may be aware of any vulnerabilities in them[36] while FOSS involves as 
many people as possible for exposing bugs quickly.

Low costs or no costs

FOSS is often free of charge although donations are often encouraged. This also allows users to better test and compare software.

Quality, collaboration and efficiency

FOSS allows for better collaboration among various parties and individuals with the goal of developing the most efficient software 
for its users or use-cases while proprietary software is typically meant to generate profits. Furthermore, in many cases more 
organizations and individuals contribute to such projects than to proprietary software.[36] It has been shown that technical 
superiority is typically the primary reason why companies choose open source software.
